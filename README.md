A java library to access an EnOcean (http://www.enocean.com/) USB300 serial device using ESP3.

## Notes 

* We will __not__ provide any binaries of that code. It is not because we want to make your life harder, it is because the "EnOcean Allicance" requires that you become a member to use an EnOcean Protocol implementation (e.g. the EEPs).
* There is currently no active development.
